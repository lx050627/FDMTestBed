testcase_um_9.text is the file defining the topology and requirements of Testcase9, which is the input of FDM+UDP algorithm
alloc_hub.txt is the file specifying hosts, links, flows (UDP/MPTCP), the number of flows at each interface, which is the output of FDM+UDP algorithm
Coincidentally, each MPTCP host only has one sub-TCPflow again in the setting of Testcase9.
